# NutriApp
A daily nutrition tracking app where you can enter the foods that you eat daily and keep track of your nutrition consumtion. 

You can choose foods from a search of a MongoDB database containing simple foods. 

If a certain food isn't available in the database you can add this food to the database through the app.


## UX




### Strategy

The goal for this site is to make it easy and intuitive for users to keep a record of their daily calories and nutrition. 

#### User Stories

- As an end user, I want to keep track of my daily meals and the calories and nutrition in those foods so to follow a healthy diet. I want the calories to be automatically calculated by the app so I don't have to spend as much time manually calculating calories and nutrition numbers.



### Scope


### Structure

The site's content structure contains two main views.

- The daily food tracking view where the days foods can be added.
- A view to add new foods and their nutrition values to the database.
- A visual graph view to see if my nutrition is improving over time.
